# Project Name: basic_voting_dapp

# About Me: Hello I am Omer, a blockchain and web3 learner student. i developed some basic programs with rust and i love learning new programming languages.

# Project Details:
This project demonstrates a basic decentralized voting application (DApp) built on the Andromeda Protocol. The DApp allows users to create proposals, vote securely, and view vote tallies in real-time.

# Features
Create new proposals
Securely cast votes
Prevent double voting
Display real-time vote counts

# Vision:
The Basic Voting DApp project aims to demonstrate the fundamental concepts of decentralized application (DApp) development using Andromeda's tools and smart contract framework. 
This project showcases a simple yet effective voting system that maintains the state of proposals and votes, prevents double voting, and provides query functions for results

# Software Development Plan
1.
The Basic Voting DApp on the Andromeda Protocol enables decentralized and transparent voting processes. This project features a user-friendly interface where users can create proposals and cast votes securely through smart contracts. The DApp ensures fairness by preventing double voting and maintaining an immutable record of all transactions. Key features include:
Proposal Creation: Users can easily create new voting proposals.
Secure Voting: Votes are securely cast and recorded on the blockchain.
Vote Tallying: Real-time vote counts are displayed, ensuring transparency.
Double Voting Prevention: Mechanisms are in place to prevent users from voting multiple times.
User-Friendly Interface: The DApp provides a seamless and intuitive user experience.
By leveraging the Andromeda Protocol, this Voting DApp showcases the potential for decentralized governance and decision-making, offering a reliable and tamper-proof solution for various voting scenarios.

2.
The Basic Voting DApp aims to revolutionize how communities make decisions by providing a secure, transparent, and tamper-proof voting system built on the Andromeda Protocol. This project empowers users to create and vote on proposals with confidence, knowing that their votes are securely recorded on the blockchain. By preventing double voting and ensuring real-time tallying, the DApp promotes fairness and trust in the voting process. Its user-friendly interface makes decentralized governance accessible to all, paving the way for broader adoption of blockchain-based decision-making in various sectors.

Software Development Plan for Basic Voting DApp
Define ADO Functions and Variables:
Functions:
createProposal(proposalDetails): Function to create a new proposal.
castVote(proposalID, vote): Function to cast a vote for a specific proposal.
getVoteCount(proposalID): Query function to retrieve the current vote count for a proposal.
preventDoubleVote(userID, proposalID): Function to ensure users can only vote once per proposal.

# Variables:
proposals: An array to store proposal details.
votes: A mapping to store user votes.
userVoteStatus: A mapping to track if a user has voted on a proposal.

Develop Smart Contract:
Implement the functions and variables defined in step 1.
Ensure proper state management and error handling within the smart contract.

Front-end Interface Development:
Proposal Creation Component: Interface for users to create new proposals.
Voting Component: Interface for users to view proposals and cast votes.
Real-time Vote Count Display: Interface to display current vote counts for each proposal.
Integrate loading and error states to enhance user experience.

Smart Contract Integration:
Connect the front-end components with the smart contract functions.
Ensure seamless interaction between the user interface and the blockchain.

Testing and Debugging:
Conduct thorough testing of both the smart contract and the front-end components.
Identify and fix any bugs or issues that arise during testing.
Verify that the voting process is secure and accurately recorded.

Deployment:
Deploy the smart contract on the Andromeda Protocol.
Host the front-end interface on a reliable web server.
Ensure the DApp is accessible to users and functioning as intended.
