# basic_voting_dapp

voting dApp that demonstrates the fundamental concepts of Andromeda development. Here's a breakdown of the implementation:

# Smart Contract (VotingSystem.ts):

Implements basic voting functionality
Maintains state for proposals and votes
Prevents double voting
Provides query functions for results

# Frontend Interface (VotingInterface.tsx):

React component for interacting with the contract
Displays proposals and current vote counts
Handles voting transactions
Shows loading and error states

# Key features demonstrated:

State management using Andromeda's tools
Basic smart contract interaction
Error handling
User interface integration
Query and execute functions

To deploy and test this dApp:

# Deploy the contract:

Copyandromeda deploy voting-system.ts --network testnet

# Initialize with proposals:

await client.instantiate(contractAddress, {
  proposals: ["Proposal 1", "Proposal 2", "Proposal 3"]
});

# Integrate the frontend component:

import { VotingInterface } from './components/VotingInterface';

function App() {
  return (
    <VotingInterface contractAddress="your-contract-address" />
  );
}

# This implementation demonstrates:

Understanding of Andromeda's contract structure
Basic state management
User interaction handling
Frontend integration
Error handling and validation
